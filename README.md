# My_radar
## Epitech project
In this project, you are asked to render a 2D visualization panel showing a simulatation of air traffic (AT).
Detection of collisions with oriented bounding box and convex forms.

## Rules
- Aircraft flies from a point A to a point B at a given speed
- If an aircraft collides with another one, the two aircrafts disappear
- Control towers donâ€™t move and have control areas
- Control areas allow aircrafts to collide with each other without being destroyed

## Usage
You need to download the CSFML librairy for running the program.
```
git clone https://github.com/zoldik333/my_radar.git
cd my_radar
make
./my_radar -h
```
